### SolGalaxy isn’t staking. It’s not lending. It’s statistical arbitrage.

# Think of it like this:

- 1,000+ new Solana tokens pop up daily  
- ~2% pump hard in the first minute  
- SolGalaxy has bots watching every single one  
- The second a token hits 2x, they sell instantly  
- Your SOL is used in hundreds of these micro-flips at once

Because WE exit in ms, and spread the risk, there’s no scenario where you lose.

Even if 90% of trades break even or dip — the 10% that hit 2x cover everything.

You deposit 1 SOL → they return 2 SOL.  
They only make money after you’re paid.

I’ve done it 4 times. Always doubled.
